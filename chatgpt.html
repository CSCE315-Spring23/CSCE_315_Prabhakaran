    <h1>The Capabilities of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are designed to think and act like humans. AI has the capability to perform tasks such as understanding natural language, recognizing images, making predictions, and solving problems.</p>
    <h2>Text Box Example:</h2>
    <p>This prompt was used to generate the following text:</p>
    <textarea rows="4" cols="50">Generate a webpage in HTML that discusses the capabilities of AI. On that webpage, create a text box containing this message and discuss how this prompt was used to generate the webpage.</textarea>
    <p>This prompt was processed by a pre-trained AI language model developed by OpenAI, known as ChatGPT. The model was trained on a massive dataset of text data to generate human-like responses to prompts. In this case, the prompt was used as input to the AI model, which generated the HTML code for the webpage discussing the capabilities of AI and the text box containing the prompt itself.</p>
